💧 Groundwater Anomaly Detection System
A machine learning-driven solution for early detection of groundwater pollution

This project offers a robust, scalable approach to monitoring groundwater quality using unsupervised anomaly detection. By analyzing deviations in chemical and physical water properties, the system identifies potential contamination events in real-time or batch data environments.

✅ Key Capabilities
🧠 Intelligent Detection
Utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify outliers in multivariate groundwater data.

📊 Visual Reporting
Generates intuitive pair plots to highlight abnormal readings across parameters.

📁 Export-Ready Output
Automatically creates a structured Excel report with labeled anomalies.

🛠️ Fully Customizable
Easily extendable to include new parameters, data sources, or ML models.

🧪 Analyzed Water Quality Indicators
The current model evaluates the following attributes:

pH

Nitrate concentration

Turbidity

Electrical conductivity

Additional parameters can be incorporated based on monitoring objectives:

Heavy metals (e.g., Lead, Arsenic)

Dissolved Oxygen (DO)

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)

🚀 Quick Start Guide
1. Install Required Packages
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
2. Run the Detection Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python groundwater_detection.py
This will:

Clean and prepare the dataset

Train an Isolation Forest model

Flag anomalies in water quality

Save results as groundwater_anomaly_results.xlsx

Visualize feature distributions with anomaly overlays

📂 Output Format
The resulting Excel report includes all input features plus:

anomaly_label → Indicates each row as 'Normal' or 'Anomaly'

Ideal for integration into dashboards, alerts, or environmental reports.

📈 Visual Insight
The model outputs a seaborn pairplot that clearly distinguishes between normal and anomalous observations across multiple features. This enhances interpretability for both data scientists and field engineers.

🔧 Advanced Customization
🔍 Swap Isolation Forest with Deep Learning Autoencoders for non-linear anomaly detection

🌐 Integrate with live sensor feeds via MQTT, Kafka, or REST APIs

📊 Build real-time dashboards using Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or Power BI

🧾 Automate report generation with PDF exports and scheduled batch runs
